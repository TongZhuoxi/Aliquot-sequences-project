# Core 5: Effect of Parameter Choices

The results of the classification in Core 4 depend on the choices of:

$$
k,\qquad i,\qquad \text{and the maximum starting value (up to 20000)}.
$$

Increasing these parameters generally produces a more accurate classification
but also increases the runtime. The project brief suggests experimenting with
different values of \( k \) and \( i \), and ensuring that the code still runs in a
"reasonable" amount of time (around 30 seconds).
