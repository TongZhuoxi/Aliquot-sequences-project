# Core 5: Effect of Parameter Choices

The results of the classification in Core 4 depend on the choices of:

$$
k,\qquad i,\qquad \text{and the maximum starting value (up to 20000)}.
$$

Increasing these parameters generally produces a more accurate classification
but also increases the runtime. The project brief suggests experimenting with
different values of \( k \) and \( i \), and ensuring that the code still runs in a
"reasonable" amount of time (around 30 seconds).

# --- Question 5 ---
import time

def experiment_parameters(M_list, k_list, i_list):
    
    for M in M_list:# Loop over each value of M (the maximum n)
        print("Now testing with M =", M)
        for k in k_list:# Loop over each iteration limit
            for cutoff in i_list:# Loop over each cutoff threshold
                print(f"\n--- Testing M={M}, k={k}, cutoff={cutoff} ---")
                count_reason(M, k, cutoff)
                start_time = time.time()

                count_reason(M, k, cutoff)
                print()

                end_time = time.time()
                print("Elapsed time:", round(end_time - start_time, 3), "seconds")



# Example experiment (small values)
experiment_parameters(
    M_list=[20000], 
    k_list=[10, 20, 50, 100],
    i_list=[10**6, 10**9]
)
